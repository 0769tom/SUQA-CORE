 SUQA


A decentralized blockchain based  giveaway platform that rewards freelancers,startups,charities and donators.


We are in the industry 4.0 revolution and digital cryptocurrencies are the future of transactions between people and machines. 
SUQA is a name of an ancient currency from Nepal that has been used thousands of years ago. It also means *to wait* in Somali language. We are introducing you a new p2p digital currency that gets you 5 %  apr  interest from 1 month time locked deposit just from waiting your funds in your wallet even if you are offline.

Bitcoin was the father of the crypto revolution and it became a tradition. SUQA will continue this tradition by enabling gpu only platform to the mining community. SUQA is the new jewel of the crypto crown with elegant implementation by our cryptography team with all benefits to miners and investors.

Quantum Resistance.

Most advanced Privacy and Security features.

75 times faster transaction speed than bitcoin with almost ZERO fees.(533 tx/s)


Interests

Term deposit interest apr %5; 

first 3 months term deposit apr will be 25% (5% + 20%),

max term deposit 1 month (from 1 year),

min 1 day (from 2 days);

bonus will be given if the term deposit end is inside the first 3 months of the blockchain.


no interests for non-locked amounts (from yes)



Benefits 

	• Time locked interest encourages users to lock up their balances.
 
	• Time locked interest favors long ,short and mid term investors.

First blockchain based cryptocurrency that makes people earn by donating to startups, freelancers, humanity charities and meeting with new people.

ALGO

With asics already here for ethereum, cryptonight,lyra2v2,neoscrypt and a lot of other popular coins and gpu algos and hackers hacking cryptocurrencies that lack security. There is a desperate need for a new complex,secure asic resistant memory optimized,post quantum  algorithm for all the gpu miners out there. Gpu mining is the future of cryptocurrency mining, it is here to stay and we are here to support that. X22i  is the newest most complex, advanced,quantum resistant algorithm for the millions of gpu miners and It is also the most power efficient yet to date.I stands for intelligence of the randomisation of the 22 algorithms.

• New x22i  Quantum Resistant Algo

22 intelligent asic,fpga and quantum resistant memory intensive algos 

POW chain X22i

blake, bmw, groestl, skein, jh, keccak, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo - X11 - hamsi, fugue - X13 - shabal, whirlpool - X15 - sha512, swifftx (added inside X17, its input spans over the 4 previous hash outputs), haval256 - X17- tiger192, lyra2-256, streebog, sha256

When the algo digest is shorter than 512 bits, it is padded with zeros (like haval256 on x17 and other such chains)

• The most asic and fpga resistant, memory intensive, power efficient,post quantum algo to date.
